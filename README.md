##Discerning Musical Preferences Based on User-Defined Input

###Aim
We aim to explore the possibilities of discerning musical preferences based on a user-defined set of musical pieces, namely by analyzing their characteristicsâ€”such as tonality, pitch, modality, and other musical characteristics that can be used to identify general taste based on an analysis of the input of the program. Our exploration will seek to find an ideal suggestion for the user based on qualitative analysis.
